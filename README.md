# Use Javadoc standard comments
Every file should have a copyright statement at the top, followed by package and import statements 
(each block separated by a blank line) and finally the class or interface declaration. In the Javadoc comments, 
describe what the class or interface does.

package com.android.internal.foo;

import android.os.Blah;
import android.view.Yada;

import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;

/**
 * Does X and Y and provides an abstraction for Z.
 */

public class Foo {
    ...
}
```

Every class and nontrivial public method you write must contain a Javadoc comment with at least one sentence describing what the class or method does. This sentence should start with a third person descriptive verb.

Examples:

´´´
/** Returns the correctly rounded positive square root of a double value. */
static double sqrt(double a) {
    ...
}
´´´
